Project Overview: Security Testing Project (Offensive and Defensive)

1. Configuration of Machines:
   - Offenser (Kali Linux on VirtualBox):
     - Install Kali Linux on VirtualBox on your local machine.
     - Ensure that Kali has access to the network and can communicate with AWS.
     - Network configuration options:
       - "Bridge" mode for direct local network access.
       - "NAT" mode for internet access but with internal network isolation.
   - Defenser (EC2 Instance on AWS):
     - Create a new EC2 instance (e.g., t2.micro if using Amazon Free Tier).
     - Set up a security group allowing only specific IP addresses or ranges to access the instance, ensuring a basic level of protection.
     - Install and configure security services such as firewalls (e.g., iptables) and monitoring tools like CloudWatch for ongoing security analysis.

2. Network Initialization:
   - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Create a VPC to organize your network, ensuring that your EC2 instance is within a private subnet if you want to limit public access, or a public subnet for testing exposure.
   - Security Groups: Configure security groups for both Kali and EC2 instances to allow the Kali machine to attack the EC2 machine on specific ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP).
   - SSH Access: Ensure that Kali can connect to the EC2 instance via SSH for initial testing of vulnerabilities and other tasks.

3. Communication between Offenser and Defenser:
   - Ensure the Kali instance can send attacks to the EC2 instance. Once the machines are connected to the network, you should be able to perform basic operations such as port scanning (with Nmap), testing for common vulnerabilities, etc.
   - Check network connectivity using tools like ping, netcat, or curl to ensure they can communicate.

4. Initial Attack Types:
   - Port Scanning and Vulnerability Assessment: Begin with tools such as Nmap and Nikto to perform basic port scanning and vulnerability scanning on the EC2 server.
   - Password Cracking and Brute Force Attacks: Test brute force attacks on SSH on the EC2 instance or web application vulnerability testing with tools like Hydra or Burp Suite.
   - Web Application Testing: If the EC2 instance hosts a web application, test for common issues such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and file inclusion vulnerabilities.

5. Basic Defense Measures:
   - Monitoring and Logging: Use AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch to monitor and analyze logs from the EC2 instance. Enable detailed logging of security events.
   - Firewall Configuration: Set up iptables on the EC2 machine to block unauthorized access, applying filtering rules as needed. Ensure only necessary traffic (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SSH) is allowed.
   - Intrusion Detection: Initially, you can use basic IDS tools like fail2ban to block repeated brute force attempts or integrate CloudWatch for more advanced analysis.
   - Security Best Practices: Regularly update and patch both the Kali machine and EC2 instance. Maintain good password policies and use encryption.

6. Project Expansion:
   - Adding Complexity on the Offenser Side: Once the basic setup is functioning, expand the offensive techniques:
     - Simulate more advanced attacks such as SQL Injection (for web apps), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and privilege escalation on the EC2 instance.
     - Explore Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to test the infrastructureâ€™s resilience.
     - Attempt exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities if available.
   - Enhancing the Defense Side: As the offensive attacks become more sophisticated, fortify the defense mechanisms:
     - Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for more robust protection of web applications.
     - Implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), such as Snort, to detect and prevent attacks.
     - Use advanced networking and filtering techniques, such as rate limiting, geo-blocking, and deep packet inspection to detect suspicious activity.
     - Regularly update all security patches and implement continuous monitoring for anomalies.
