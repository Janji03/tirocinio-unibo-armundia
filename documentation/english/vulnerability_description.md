# Documentation on Script Vulnerabilities

## 1. Apache Struts 2.3.32

### **Description**
Apache Struts is an open-source framework for developing Java web applications. It uses OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) for request processing and interaction with server objects.

### **Functionality**
- A user sends an HTTP request to a web page managed by Struts.
- The request is interpreted by the framework and routed to a management class called **Action Class**.
- The response is formatted and returned to the user via JSP or another rendering method.

### **Vulnerabilities**
- **CVE-2017-5638**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via command injection in the `Content-Type` header.
- **Attack**: An attacker can craft an HTTP request to execute arbitrary code on the server with Tomcat process privileges.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access and potential system-wide compromise.

## 2. Apache HTTPD

### **Description**
Apache HTTPD is a web server used to serve HTML pages and dynamic content via modules like PHP and CGI.

### **Functionality**
- Receives HTTP requests and returns web pages.
- Can be configured to manage authentication, logging, and caching.

### **Vulnerabilities**
- **CVE-2017-9798**: Poorly configured `OPTIONS` directive that can leak sensitive information.
- **Directory Traversal**: Attackers can access sensitive files by manipulating paths (`../../../etc/passwd`).
- **Misconfigurations**: Allows execution of insecure CGI scripts.

## 3. Jenkins

### **Description**
Jenkins is a CI/CD automation software that enables scripting for testing and deployment.

### **Functionality**
- Automatically executes builds for testing and code release.
- Includes a Groovy scripting console for custom execution.

### **Vulnerabilities**
- **CVE-2018-1000861**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) through scripting interface.
- **Unauthenticated access to Groovy console**: Allows attackers to execute commands with elevated privileges.

## 4. MySQL

### **Description**
MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for data storage and management.

### **Functionality**
- Web applications connect to the database using credentials.
- SQL queries are used to query, modify, and manage data.

### **Vulnerabilities**
- **Weak credentials (root:root, admin:admin)**: Facilitates brute-force attacks.
- **Remote access enabled**: Allows unauthorized users to connect from the internet.
- **SQL Injection**: Manipulated queries can allow unauthorized access or data modification.

## 5. PHP CGI

### **Description**
PHP is a web scripting language. The CGI mode allows PHP scripts to execute as separate processes.

### **Functionality**
- Apache receives HTTP requests and passes them to PHP via CGI.
- PHP interprets the code and returns an HTML response.

### **Vulnerabilities**
- **CVE-2012-1823**: Attackers can pass parameters to execute arbitrary code (`? -d auto_prepend_file=evil.php`).
- **Impact**: Full server control via remote command execution.

## 6. Samba 3.0.20

### **Description**
Samba is software that enables file sharing between Linux and Windows systems via the SMB protocol.

### **Functionality**
- Allows users to access shared directories over the network.
- Can be configured to require authentication or allow anonymous access.

### **Vulnerabilities**
- **CVE-2007-2447**: Attackers can execute commands as root by exploiting an SMB authentication flaw.
- **Guest access enabled**: Unrestricted access to shared files without authentication.

## 7. vsftpd 2.3.4

### **Description**
vsftpd is an FTP server used for managing file transfers.

### **Functionality**
- Users connect via FTP clients and can upload or download files.

### **Vulnerabilities**
- **CVE-2011-2523**: This version contains a **backdoor** that allows remote access using the username `:)`.
- **Impact**: Attackers can obtain a remote shell on port 6200.

---

## 8. WordPress + WP File Manager

### **Description**
WordPress is a CMS for managing websites. Plugins extend its functionality but can introduce vulnerabilities.

### **Functionality**
- Administrators can upload content and install plugins.
- The WP File Manager plugin allows file management directly from the WordPress panel.

### **Vulnerabilities**
- **CVE-2020-25213**: This plugin allows the upload of malicious PHP files.
- **Impact**: Attackers can obtain a web shell and take control of the site.
